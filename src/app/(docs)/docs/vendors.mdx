title: Vendors

SDKMAN! is unique in that it empowers SDK Vendors to publish their candidate
releases on our platform. We provide a secure API that can be used to manage all
aspects of a release on SDKMAN!. Such aspects include **Releasing** a new
version, setting an existing version as **Default** (Stable) and **Announcing**
the release on the SDKMAN! CLI broadcast and Twitter feed.

## Operations

The API is a simple JSON REST API that allows three basic operations:

- Release a new candidate version
- Set the default for a candidate
- Broadcast a release message

## Access

This is a secured API, and requires appropriate credentials to perform the above
operations. Access will be granted on a case-by-case basis to Vendors who are
interested in making their SDK available on SDKMAN!. If you want to publish your
releases on SDKMAN!, please follow the Vendor Onboarding
[wiki page](https://github.com/sdkman/sdkman-cli/wiki/Vendor-onboarding-process)
and then [contact us](mailto:info@sdkman.io) for help with setting up your
credentials.

## Endpoints

The simplest way to call the API is by using [curl](https://curl.se/). Of
course, any other client can be used to perform the API operations.

### Release a new Candidate Version

This will perform a minor release on SDKMAN!. It will simply add the new
candidate version, but will not make it the default version for that candidate.
This endpoint supports `POST` and `DELETE` HTTP methods. The `POST` endpoint is
idempotent.

```shell
curl -X POST \
-H "Consumer-Key: CONSUMER_KEY" \
-H "Consumer-Token: CONSUMER_TOKEN" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Accept: application/json" \
-d '{"candidate": "groovy", "version": "2.4.2", "url": "https://groovy.jfrog.io/artifactory/dist-release-local/groovy-zips/apache-groovy-binary-2.4.6.zip"}' \
https://vendors.sdkman.io/release
```

#### Multi-platform binary distributions

We support both universal and multi-platform binary distributions. Universal
binaries run on all platforms, so you need to publish only a single SDK archive
to our API. Multi-platform APIs are compiled specifically for the target
platform and require an archive per target platform to be published. We
currently support the following platforms:

- LINUX_64
- LINUX_ARM64
- LINUX_32
- LINUX_ARM32SF
- LINUX_ARM32HF
- MAC_OSX
- MAC_ARM64
- WINDOWS_64

To indicate the target platform, a `platform` key with associated platform
should be included in the payload. If no `platform` is included, we assume the
value to be `UNIVERSAL`.

#### Multi-vendor candidates

For vendors who wish to publish to a multi-vendor candidate like Java or JMC, we
require the presence of a _vendor string_ in the JSON payload. This will result
in a new version comprised of `$version-$vendor`, so in this case it would
appear as `11.0.10-zulu` on SDKMAN!.

#### Checksums

An optional map of `checksums` may be provided in the payload for each published
binary. Supported checksum algorithms are:

- MD5
- SHA-1
- SHA-224
- SHA-256
- SHA-384
- SHA-512

#### Sample payload

An example payload demonstrating the release of a multi-platform Java binary for
`LINUX_64` published by Azul as `zulu` with two checksums will look something
like this:

```json
{
  "candidate": "java",
  "version": "11.0.10",
  "vendor": "zulu",
  "url": "https://cdn.azul.com/zulu/bin/zulu11.45.27-ca-jdk11.0.10-linux_x64.tar.gz",
  "platform": "LINUX_64",
  "checksums": {
    "MD5": "93c9d427af64f2da8c00c9219360815b",
    "SHA-256": "0bd85593bae021314378f3b146cfe36a6c9b0afd964d897c34201034ace3e785"
  }
}
```

### Set existing Version as Default for Candidate

When calling this endpoint for an existing candidate version, it will make it
the default version for that candidate. This makes a minor release a major
release!

```shell
curl -X PUT \
-H "Consumer-Key: CONSUMER_KEY" \
-H "Consumer-Token: CONSUMER_TOKEN" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Accept: application/json" \
-d '{"candidate": "groovy", "version": "2.3.8"}' \
https://vendors.sdkman.io/default
```

## GitHub Actions

If you're using GitHub Actions for your CI/CD pipeline, SDKMAN! provides
official GitHub Actions that can help you automate the release process.

### SDKMAN! Release Action

The [SDKMAN! Release Action](https://github.com/sdkman/sdkman-release-action)
allows you to release a new version of your candidate to SDKMAN! directly from
your GitHub workflow.

#### Features

- Release a new version of your SDK to SDKMAN!
- Support for multi-platform binaries
- Support for multi-vendor candidates
- Support for checksums

#### Basic Usage

```yaml
name: Release to SDKMAN!

on:
  release:
    types: [published]

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Release to SDKMAN!
        uses: sdkman/sdkman-release-action@v0.2.0
        with:
          consumer_key: ${{ secrets.SDKMAN_CONSUMER_KEY }}
          consumer_token: ${{ secrets.SDKMAN_CONSUMER_TOKEN }}
          candidate: myCandidateName
          version: ${{ github.event.release.tag_name }}
          url:
            https://github.com/myorg/myrepo/releases/download/${{
            github.event.release.tag_name }}/mycandidatename-${{
            github.event.release.tag_name }}.zip
```

#### Advanced Usage

For multi-platform releases or when adding checksums:

```yaml
name: Release Java to SDKMAN!

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      version:
        description: 'Version to release'
        required: true

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Release Linux x64 to SDKMAN!
        uses: sdkman/sdkman-release-action@v0.2.0
        with:
          consumer-key: ${{ secrets.SDKMAN_CONSUMER_KEY }}
          consumer-token: ${{ secrets.SDKMAN_CONSUMER_TOKEN }}
          candidate: java
          version: ${{ github.event.inputs.version }}
          url:
            https://github.com/acme/java/releases/download/${{
            github.event.inputs.version }}/java-linux-x64.tar.gz
          platform: LINUX_64
          checksum-md5: 'abcd1234...'
          checksum-sha-512: 'efgh5678...'
```

## Gradle SDK Vendor Plugin

If fiddling with cURL (or HttpClient) isn't your thing, you could consider using
our Gradle plugin. The plugin allows the release to be done as a side effect of
your CI build! It exposes several useful tasks like:

- `sdkReleaseVersion`
- `sdkDefaultVersion`
- `sdkAnnounceVersion`

It also exposes some convenience tasks that roll the above into single tasks:

- `sdkMajorRelease`: performs release, default and structured announce
- `sdkMinorRelease`: performs release and structured announce, _no_ default

For more details of about this plugin, as well as how to configure it, please
refer to the [Github Page](https://github.com/sdkman/gradle-sdkvendor-plugin)
for the project.

## Maven SDK Vendor Plugin

If fiddling with cURL (or HttpClient) or Gradle isn't your thing, you could
consider using our Maven plugin. The plugin allows the release to be done as a
side effect of your CI build! It exposes several useful goals like:

- `release`
- `default`
- `announce`

It also exposes some convenience goals that roll the above into single goals:

- `major-release`: performs release, default and structured announce
- `minor-release`: performs release and structured announce, _no_ default

For more details of about this plugin, as well as how to configure it, please
refer to the [Github Page](https://github.com/sdkman/sdkman-vendor-maven-plugin)
for the project.

## Broadcast a Structured Message

This will result in a structured message announcement on social media and
SDKMAN! CLI. The result will look something like:
`grails 3.0.0 available for download. https://git.io/release`. The url can point
to the github release page or the version's changelog. This message will be
announced to the broadcast channel of SDKMAN! CLI, as well as on the
[@sdkman\_](https://x.com/sdkman_) X feed.

```shell
curl -X POST \
-H "Consumer-Key: CONSUMER_KEY" \
-H "Consumer-Token: CONSUMER_TOKEN" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Accept: application/json" \
-d '{"candidate": "grails", "version": "3.0.0", "url": "https://git.io/release"}' \
https://vendors.sdkman.io/announce/struct
```
