## Installing an SDK

### Latest Stable

Install the **latest stable** version of your SDK of choice (say, Java JDK) by
running the following command:

```shell
sdk install java
```

You will see something like the following output:

```shell
Downloading: java 21.0.4-tem

In progress...

######################################################################## 100.0%

Installing: java 21.0.4-tem
Done installing!
```

Now you will be prompted if you want this version to be set as **default.**

```shell
Do you want java 21.0.4-tem to be set as default? (Y/n):
```

Answering _yes_ (or _hitting enter_) will ensure that all subsequent shells
opened will have this version of the SDK in use by default.

```shell
Setting java 21.0.4-tem as default.
```

### Specific Version

Need a **specific** version of an SDK? Simply qualify the version you require:

```shell
sdk install scala 3.4.2
```

All subsequent steps same as above.

### Install Local Version(s)

Using a snapshot version? Already have a local installation? Setup a local
version by specifying the path to the local installation:

```shell
sdk install groovy 3.0.0-SNAPSHOT /path/to/groovy-3.0.0-SNAPSHOT
```

```shell
sdk install java 17-zulu /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/zulu-17.jdk/Contents/Home
```

Note that the local version name (_3.0.0-SNAPSHOT_ and _17-zulu_ in the examples
above) must be a unique name which is not already in the list of available
version names.

## Remove Version

Remove an installed version.

```shell
sdk uninstall scala 3.4.2
```

Note that removing a local version will not remove the local installation.

## List Candidates

To get a listing of available Candidates:

```shell
sdk list
```

This will render a searchable alphabetic list with name, current stable default
version, website URL, description and easy install command for each Candidate.
The output is piped to `less` so standard keyboard shortcuts may be used with
`q` to exit.

```shell
================================================================================

================================================================================
q-quit                                  /-search down

Java Platform, Standard Edition (or Java SE) is a widely used platform for
development and deployment of portable code for desktop and server environments.
Java SE uses the object-oriented Java programming language. It is part of the
Java software-platform family. Java SE defines a wide range of general-purpose
APIs – such as Java APIs for the Java Class Library – and also includes the Java
Language Specification and the Java Virtual Machine Specification.

$ sdk install java

## List Versions

To get a listing of Candidate Versions:

```shell
sdk list groovy
```

This will result in a list view showing the available, local, installed and
current versions of the SDK.

## Use Version

Choose to use a given version in the current terminal:

```shell
sdk use scala 3.4.2
```

It is important to realise that this will switch the candidate version **for the
current shell only**. To make this change permanent, use the `default` command
instead.

## Default Version

Chose to make a given version the default:

```shell
sdk default scala 3.4.2
```

This will ensure that all subsequent shells will start with version 3.4.2 in
use.

## Current Version(s)

To see what is currently in use for a Candidate:

```shell
sdk current java

Using java version 21.0.4-tem
```

To see what is currently in use for **all** Candidates:

```shell
sdk current

Using:
groovy: 4.0.22
java: 21.0.4-tem
scala: 3.4.2
```

## Env Command

Want to switch to a specific JDK or SDK every time you visit a project? This can
be achieved through an `.sdkmanrc` file in the base directory of your project.
This file can be generated automatically by issuing the following command:

```shell
sdk env init
```

A config file with the following content has now been created in the current
directory:

```shell
# Enable auto-env through the sdkman_auto_env config
# Add key=value pairs of SDKs to use below
java=21.0.4-tem
```

The file is pre-populated with the current JDK version in use, but can contain
as many key-value pairs of supported SDKs as needed. To switch to the
configuration present in your `.sdkmanrc` file, simply issue the following
command:

```shell
sdk env
```

You should see output that looks something like this:

```shell
Using java version 21.0.4-tem in this shell.
```

Your path has now also been updated to use any of these SDKs in your current
shell. When leaving a project, you may want to reset the SDKs to their default
version. This can be achieved by entering:

```shell
sdk env clear

Restored java version to 21.0.4-tem (default)
```

After checking out a new project, you may be missing some SDKs specified in the
project's `.sdkmanrc` file. To install these missing SDKs, just type:

```shell
sdk env install

Downloading: java 21.0.4-tem

In progress...

######################################################################## 100,0%

Repackaging Java 21.0.4-tem...

Done repackaging...

Installing: java 21.0.4-tem
Done installing!
```

Do you want to switch SDK versions automatically when you `cd` into a directory?
This can be done by setting the `sdkman_auto_env=true` in the SDKMAN
configuration. Note that this will also reset any project-specific SDKs to their
default version when leaving the directory.

## Upgrade Version(s)

To see what is currently out of date for a Candidate on your system:

```shell
sdk upgrade springboot

Upgrade:
springboot (1.2.4.RELEASE, 1.2.3.RELEASE < 3.3.1)
```

To see what is outdated for **all** Candidates:

```shell
sdk upgrade

Upgrade:
gradle (2.3, 1.11, 2.4, 2.5 < 8.9)
grails (2.5.1 < 6.2.0)
springboot (1.2.4.RELEASE, 1.2.3.RELEASE < 3.3.1
```

## SDKMAN! Version

Display the current script and native versions of SDKMAN!:

```shell
sdk version

SDKMAN!
script: 5.7.0
native: 0.1.3
```

## Offline Mode

Initially called _Aeroplane Mode_, this allows SDKMAN! to function when working
offline. It has a parameter that can be passed to _enable_ or _disable_ the
offline mode.

```shell
sdk offline enable

Forced offline mode enabled.
```

```shell
sdk offline disable

Online mode re-enabled!
```

When operating in **offline** mode, most commands will still work even though
they will operate in a scaled down capacity. An example is the list command,
which will only display the currently installed and active version(s):

```shell
sdk list groovy

------------------------------------------------------------
Offline Mode: only showing installed groovy versions
------------------------------------------------------------
> 2.4.4
* 2.4.3
------------------------------------------------------------
* - installed
> - currently in use
------------------------------------------------------------
```

The offline mode will also be disabled/enabled automatically when the internet
becomes available/unavailable. Naturally, commands that require internet
connectivity will not function but give a warning.

## Self-Update

Installs a new version of SDKMAN! if available.

```shell
sdk selfupdate
```

If no new version is available an appropriate message will be displayed.
Re-installation may be forced by passing the force parameter to the command:

```shell
sdk selfupdate force
```

Automatic daily checks for new versions of SDKMAN! will also be performed on the
behalf of the user.

## Update

Periodically SDKMAN! requires a refresh to become aware of new (or removed)
candidates. When candidate metadata has potentially grown stale, a warning is
displayed with instruction on how to update. By simply running the following
command, the candidate cache will be refreshed and new candidates will become
available for installation:

```shell
WARNING: SDKMAN is out-of-date and requires an update.

sdk update

Adding new candidates(s): kotlin
```

## Flush

It should rarely be necessary to flush SDKMAN!'s local state. The flush command
helps with this, so you don't need to delete any directories. **Manually
deleting directories like the `.sdkman/tmp` directory will break SDKMAN! Always
use the `flush` command instead!**

```shell
sdk flush
```

## Home

When using SDKMAN in scripts, it is often useful to get the absolute path of
where an SDK resides (similar to how the `java_home` command works on macOS).
For this we have the `home` command.

```shell
sdk home java 21.0.4-tem

/home/myuser/.sdkman/candidates/java/21.0.4-tem
```

## Help

You can get basic help by running the following command:

```shell
sdk help
```

This should render a useful top-level help page. You can add qualifier to this
command to get help about a specific sub-command.

```shell
sdk help install
```

## Configuration

Configuration can be found in the `~/.sdkman/etc/config` file. To edit the
configuration, the `sdk config` command may be issued to edit this file in the
system editor. The following configurations are available:

```shell
# make sdkman non-interactive, preferred for CI environments
sdkman_auto_answer=true|false

# check for newer versions and prompt for update
sdkman_selfupdate_feature=true|false

# disables SSL certificate verification
# https://github.com/sdkman/sdkman-cli/issues/327
# HERE BE DRAGONS....
sdkman_insecure_ssl=true|false

# configure curl timeouts
sdkman_curl_connect_timeout=5
sdkman_curl_continue=true
sdkman_curl_max_time=10

# subscribe to the beta channel
sdkman_beta_channel=true|false

# enable verbose debugging
sdkman_debug_mode=true|false

# enable colour mode
sdkman_colour_enable=true|false

# enable automatic env
sdkman_auto_env=true|false

# enable bash or zsh auto-completion
sdkman_auto_complete=true|false
```
