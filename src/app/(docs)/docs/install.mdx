title: Installation
---

Installing SDKMAN! on UNIX is a breeze. It effortlessly sets up on macOS, Linux
and Windows (with WSL). Plus, it's compatible with both Bash and ZSH shells.

Just launch a new terminal and type in:

```shell
curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to wrap up the installation. Afterward, open a
new terminal or run the following in the same shell:

```shell
source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"
```

Lastly, run the following snippet to confirm the installation's success:

```shell
sdk version
```

You should see output containing the latest script and native versions:

```shell
SDKMAN!
script: 5.19.0
native: 0.5.0
```

## Windows installation

For Windows, there are two installation routes:

1. **WSL Approach**: Install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) before attempting
   SDKMAN installation. A basic toolset (bash, zip, unzip, curl) is necessary.
   Most times, it works out of the box.
2. **Git Bash Solution**: If you use Git Bash for Windows, you'll need to
   supplement it with MinGW to have the required toolset for SDKMAN. There are
   some issues with this approach, but it works for the most part.

    Remember, SDKMAN requires a bash environment to run. On Windows, it can't be
    natively installed; you need WSL or MSYS+MinGW. We no longer support Cygwin.

## Beta channel

To leave the beta channel, simply set `sdkman_beta_channel` to false in
`~/.sdkman/etc/config`, then run:

```shell
sdk selfupdate force
```

## Uninstallation

Here is how you go about removing SDKMAN! from your system:

1. Optionally backup and then remove the installation:

   ```shell
   tar zcvf ~/sdkman-backup_$(date +%F-%kh%M).tar.gz -C ~/ .sdkman
   rm -rf ~/.sdkman
   ```

2. Remove initialization snippet from your shell configs. Edit and remove the
   initialisation snippet from your `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile` and/or `.profile`
   files. If you use ZSH, remove it from the `.zshrc` file. The snippet of code
   to be removed looks something like this:

   ```shell
   #THIS MUST BE AT THE END OF THE FILE FOR SDKMAN TO WORK!!!
   [[ -s "/home/dudette/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh" ]] && source "/home/dudette/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"
   ```

   Once removed, you have successfully uninstalled SDKMAN! from your machine.

## Install to a custom location

Lastly, if you want to install SDKMAN! in a custom location, like
`/usr/local/sdkman`, make sure you have full access rights and that the folder
doesn't exist. Export `SDKMAN_DIR` before installing:

```shell
export SDKMAN_DIR="/usr/local/sdkman" && curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
```

## Install without modifying shell config

And for installs on CI where shell config modification isn't appropriate, add
`rcupdate=false` as a parameter when downloading the installer:

```shell
curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io?rcupdate=false" | bash
```

## CI Mode

For automated environments like CI/CD pipelines, SDKMAN! offers a dedicated CI
mode that optimizes the installation for non-interactive use:

```shell
curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io?ci=true" | bash
```

CI mode automatically:

- Answers all prompts (sets `sdkman_auto_answer=true`)
- Disables colored output for cleaner logs (sets `sdkman_colour_enable=false`)
- Turns off the self-update feature to prevent unexpected updates (sets
  `sdkman_selfupdate_feature=false`)

You can combine this with other parameters as needed:

```shell
curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io?ci=true&rcupdate=false" | bash
```

That's all there is to it! Now let's dive into [Usage](/usage).
